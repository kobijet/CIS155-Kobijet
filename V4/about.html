        <h3>V4</h3>
        <ul>
          <li class=feat-think>Decided to icksnay the merch and music pages.
            Music is represented on the front page and merch would require me to use AWS, meaning I'd have to pay for it.
            Maybe if I deploy this site, I will use it.</li>
          <li class=feat-think>The contact us does not do anything, as I don't have a mail server. It DOES, however, post to the URL.</li>
          <li class="feat-rmv">- Got rid of that gradient, it looked ugly...</li>
          <li class="feat-rmv">- Removed the merch and music pages</li>
          <li class="feat-add">+ Titles on the pages</li>
          <li class="feat-add">+ Contact us page</li>
          <li class="feat-add">+ Photo gallery</li>

        <h3>V3</h3>
        <ul>
          <li class=feat-think>I am actually a whole lot happier with the layout of my website than I was in V2, even though I only added one table!</li>
          <li class="feat-add">+ Adjusted the background; Blends in better with the gradient now</li>
          <li class="feat-add">+ Flexbox for main content</li>
          <li class="feat-add">+ Tour date table!</li>

        <h3>V2</h3>
        <ul>
          <li class=feat-think>I am trying to figure out how to make the icons better quality as well as how I can add a hover effect over the images.</li>
          <li class="feat-rmv">- Ugly footer</li>
          <li class="feat-add">+ Added social media icons and links</li>
          <li class="feat-add">+ Grid layout for page content; Flexboxes still doing the heavy lifting overall</li>
          <li class="feat-add">+ Sticky footer! Uses fixed positioning</li>
          <li class="feat-add">+ Separate CSS page for the about page; New styling for the changelog</li>

        <h3>V1</h3>

        <p>This is a pretty good starting point for my website, I believe.</p>
        <p>I want to do more responsive web design, as well as organize my pages a whole lot better.
        I am trying to pull up content to add here.</p>
        <p>I would like to make this footer sticky, as in stick to the bottom of the page. That may or may not happen...
        I was having some trouble using these flexboxes to get it done.  The other trouble I am having is setting the flexboxes to
      have a fixed width, so that the footer and navbar are the same.</p>
